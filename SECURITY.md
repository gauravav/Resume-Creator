- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Version, configuration, and environment details
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations for remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Fix Deployment**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Production Environment

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Generate new JWT secret (min 64 characters)
   - Update database passwords
   - Replace MinIO access keys
   - Use strong, unique passwords for all services

2. **Enable HTTPS/TLS**
   - Obtain valid SSL certificates
   - Configure HSTS headers
   - Disable HTTP redirects
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher

3. **Network Security**
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Limit database access to application only
   - Use VPN for administrative access
   - Enable DDoS protection

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Set up log aggregation
   - Configure security alerts
   - Monitor for unusual patterns
   - Regular log reviews

5. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Regular security assessments
   - Backup and recovery testing

### Environment Variables Security

Never commit these to version control:
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`
- API keys or tokens
- Database connection strings

Use secure secret management:
- Docker Secrets (production)
- Kubernetes Secrets
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- HashiCorp Vault

### Database Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Create dedicated application user
   - Grant minimal required permissions
   - Disable default postgres user
   - Use connection pooling

2. **Network Isolation**
   - Database should not be publicly accessible
   - Use private networks/VPCs
   - Configure pg_hba.conf appropriately
   - Enable SSL connections

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Regular automated backups
   - Test backup restoration
   - Implement data retention policies

### File Storage Security

1. **MinIO Configuration**
   - Use strong access credentials
   - Enable server-side encryption
   - Configure bucket policies
   - Regular access audits

2. **File Validation**
   - Never trust file extensions
   - Validate file headers/signatures
   - Scan for malware
   - Limit file sizes appropriately

## Security Monitoring

### Log Analysis

Monitor these security events:

- **Authentication Failures**: Multiple failed login attempts
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Potential DoS attempts
- **File Upload Anomalies**: Suspicious file types or sizes
- **Path Traversal Attempts**: Unauthorized file access tries
- **SQL Injection Attempts**: Malicious query patterns
- **XSS Attempts**: Script injection in inputs

### Alerting Thresholds

Set up alerts for:
- 5+ failed authentication attempts from same IP (15 minutes)
- Rate limit violations exceeding 50 requests
- File uploads containing suspicious content
- Database query errors indicating injection attempts
- Unusual file access patterns

### Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reports
2. **Analysis**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update procedures and controls
